To prepare this phase, copy the file of the cleaned_system_model folder to the Camunda Platform extension's folder webapps\reasoning_bpm_war_exploded.
If you chose to copy the files somewhere else, make shure the Camunda Platform can access them and change the respective paths in the Upload task by editing the .bpmn file of this phase.
Furthermore, copy the files of the tboxes folder to webapps\reasoning_bpm_war_exploded\tboxes.
If you want to put them somewhere else, like with the other files, make them accessable to Camunda Platform edit for the "Add ICS Ontology" task the respective path of the testbed1 mapping ontology and keep the files in the same folder.
