To prepare this phase, copy the files of the component_models folder to a folder with the path webapps\reasoning_bpm_war_exploded\DeviceInstanceOntologies of the Camunda Platform.
If you chose to copy the files somewhere else, make shure the Camunda Platform can access them and change the respective paths in the Upload task by editing the .bpmn file of this phase.
